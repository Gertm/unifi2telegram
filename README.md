# unifi2telegram
Send camera snapshot to telegram on motion.

This little program monitors the recording.log file made by unifi-video.  
All you have to do is configure where the cameras are in your network and set up a Telegram bot. ( https://core.telegram.org/bots )  

Make sure you enabled the snapshotting feature in your unifi cameras, you can set this up through the nvr dashboard.

WARNING: This is still largely untested, although I am using it myself and it works pretty well for me.
